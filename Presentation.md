This is the Presentation & Presentation Slide Deck

# Slide 1
Introduction
-	Open source community is a group established to bring collaboration to resolve issues
-	Free to use and access
-	Provides free source code for software, support, documentation, and variety of expertise
-	Organizations have their own issues in achieving the goals and objectives
-	Information Technology (IT) is always emerging and possess challenges to the organization in reaching the goals
-	Organization cannot always expand and spend while trying to solve each problem
-	Open source is the way to go!

# Slide 2
Problem
-	Developers bring the outside code to the organization’s code base
-	While bringing the outside code, they also bring risks to the organization
-	The risks include licenses and vulnerabilities
-	If the code is modified to tailor the organization’s needs, it needs to be contributed back to the community by the organization
-	Need an efficient method of keeping track of communication between organization and the open source community

# Slide 3
Solution
-	A system as described in the Data Flow Diagram (DFD) model
-	Automate the processes of scanning licenses and vulnerabilities to and from the organization
-	Reduce the efforts for the developers and managers in maintaining the package information
-	Allow managers to properly determine and enforce policies
-	Provide a better way for developers to modify the package and update as necessary
-	This will provide the project manager to access risk associated with the software project
-	Let’s dive in to the deliverables!
