This is the Executive Summary of the Designed System

The definition of open source does not necessarily mean free access to source code. It also involves the responsibilities with distribution and maintenance. The terms that anyone wanting to use open source need to comply with free redistribution, source code distribution, modified work distribution, no discrimination, technology neutral license, license should not be product specific and license must not restrict other software (The Open Source Definition, 2007).
