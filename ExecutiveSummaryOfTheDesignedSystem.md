This is the Executive Summary of the Designed System

The definition of open source does not necessarily mean free access to source code. It also involves the responsibilities with distribution and maintenance. The terms that anyone wanting to use open source need to comply with free redistribution, source code distribution, modified work distribution, no discrimination, technology neutral license, license should not be product specific and license must not restrict other software (The Open Source Definition, 2007). With the establishment of open source community, organizations can easily get access to solutions that can resolve its issues. The developers involved in developing source code for the organizations usually bring in the open source code to the organization which helps them better achieve the business requirements. Open source software and code can be used by anyone but need to do that under the license agreement specified within the package. Developers integrate the code through the help of open source communities like Stack Overflow. This is an example of a community where the developers can post issues and get solutions or provide solutions to issues posted.
