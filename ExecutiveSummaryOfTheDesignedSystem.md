The definition of open source does not necessarily mean free access to source code. It also involves the responsibilities with distribution and maintenance. The terms that anyone wanting to use open source need to comply with free redistribution, source code distribution, modified work distribution, no discrimination, technology neutral license, license should not be product specific and license must not restrict other software (The Open Source Definition, 2007). With the establishment of open source community, organizations can easily get access to solutions that can resolve its issues. The developers involved in developing source code for the organizations usually bring in the open source code to the organization which helps them better achieve the business requirements.
